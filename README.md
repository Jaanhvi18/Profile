# Hi, I'm Jaanhvi Agarwal 👋

## ⭐️ About Me:
Hi there! I’m a **very** recent Computer Science graduate from Colgate University with a passion for solving complex problems and building creative solutions. Whether it’s designing machine learning models, exploring natural language processing, or developing full-stack applications, I’m always up for a challenge. Technology fascinates me because it has the power to transform lives, and I love being part of that transformation.

## 💻 Tech Stack:
I’ve picked up a versatile set of tools and technologies over the years to power my projects:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C, Ruby, SQL  
- **Technologies & Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn, React, Flask, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **Specialized Tools**: spaCy, NLTK, Textacy, Docker, Kubernetes, Redis  
- **Cloud Platforms**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Azure  
- **Areas of Expertise**: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, High-Performance Computing, and Distributed Systems  

## 🚀 What I'm Working On:
Here’s a glimpse into some of the projects I’ve been working on recently:

- **Making Wind Turbines Smarter**: I developed machine learning models to predict generator and main bearing temperatures, helping optimize maintenance schedules and improve turbine performance.  
- **Gaming Sentiment Analysis**: I created a pipeline to scrape gaming-related posts from Reddit and used NLP to analyze bug reports, sentiment, and trends. This helped visualize key insights from user feedback.  
- **DNS in an IPv6-Only World**: As part of a team project, I implemented a custom recursive DNS resolver to evaluate how well domains support IPv6.  
- **3D Scene Recognition**: I enhanced 3D spatial perception from 2D images by designing CNN models, including a custom architecture and VGG-16 for classification tasks.  
- **Agreement Errors in Neural Language Models**: I conducted research on subject-verb agreement errors in LSTM models, creating datasets with controlled error injection to evaluate how models handle tricky syntactic structures like nested clauses and prepositional phrases. The findings shed light on where models fall short and how they can improve.
